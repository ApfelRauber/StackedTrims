### FAQ:
+ **Forge or Fabric?** This mod is for fabric.
+ **Forge Version?** Maybe Coming Soon
+ **Client or Server?** It is possible for Vanilla clients to join a server with this mod, only the newest armor trim will render though. -> Needs to be on both for it to work.
+ **Modpack?** You can use it in any modpack, credit me if possible.
+ **Curse Forge?** [Here](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/stacked-armor-trims)

### This mod is incompatible with:
+ **Immediately Fast** [ [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/immediatelyfast) | [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/immediatelyfast) ] Only one piece of armor renders its trims in the inventory.
